        <p>This web site serves the datasets collected from over 2000
           adolescents and their parents, and processed by the IMAGEN
           consortium to study mental health in young Europeans. It
           includes demographics, neuropsychological assessments, medical
           questionnaires, MR neuroimaging and genomics. All types of data
           were acquired for the baseline, only some of them for the
           follow-up 1 and follow-up 2.
